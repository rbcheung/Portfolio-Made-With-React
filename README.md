# Portfolio Made with React.

This assignment was created to allow me to implement all of the knowledge and skills that I have acrrued over the course of the bootcamp to develop the foundations of my personal portfolio. This portfolio is a work in progress and will be further developed down the road as my skills and knowledge increase!

To hit the requirements of the challenge I had to ensure the following;

## Design
* Use mobile-first design.
